Description: This package assists in the whole process of designing and evaluating RCTs.
    Robust treatment assignment by strata/blocks, that handles misfits; 
    Power calculations of the minimum detectable treatment effect (See Athey, Imbens 2016);
    Balance tables of T-test of covariates; 
    Balance Regression: (treatment ~ X'b) with F-test of null model; 
    Impact_evaluation: Impact evaluation regressions. This function
    gives you the option to include control_vars, fixed effect variables,
    cluster variables (for robust SE), multiple endogenous variables and
    multiple heterogeneous variables (to test treatment effect heterogeneity)
    summary_statistics: Function that creates a summary statistics table with statistics 
    ntile_label: Same as ntile from dplyr but creates a factor variable with 
    min and max labels attach to each category.
